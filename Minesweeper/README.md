  In this project we have game Minesweeper, which have different modes to play.
  We have field 9*9 and the user chooses how many mines he wants on the field. After that game begins and we have empty field. Character '.' means empty cell.
  If we want to mark the mine we should enter the coordinates and mode "mine" (example: "5 5 mine"). And after that the cell will be marked with *.
  If we want to open cells we should enter the coordinates and mode "free" (example: "5 5 free"). And after that this cell and cells around will be opened.
  If the user tries to open a cell with a mine, he loses. And in this case he will see all mines (mine denoted as 'X').

  Opened cell denoted as '/'. The number in the cell means number of mines around this cell.
