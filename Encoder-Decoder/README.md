In this project we have encoder which use Hamming code to encode message.
You need to create file "send.txt" and write to it some text.
When you choose command encode, encoder writes new text to "encoded.txt".
When you choose command send, you create one mistake in your text, and write it to "received.txt".
And if you have encoded text with mistakes you can use command decode to restore the original text.
